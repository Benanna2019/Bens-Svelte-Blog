## New Framework

Welcome to my site. This is a continual work in progress.

I have been writing many blogs over the past few months and all of them have been hosted on my NextJS site. A lot of the blogs I have written have been about Svelte.

So, this blog site is the practical out-workings of learning Svelte.

Consider Svelte to be like React and Sapper to be like NextJS.

Svelte brings many new and awesome features to frontend development that I love, such as Animations and simplifies things very nicely for a developer.

So, this is a my blog site built with Svelte and Sapper. It will morph and grow overtime but for now, I am happy to be using this! I will pull all of my old blog posts from my NextJS site before I close it down.

For those of you who are reading this in the future, my old blog site was built with NextJS which is still an amazing framework. I plan to write a blog post on why I still/would still use NextJS for many projects.

I am excited about the future of Svelte and what is to come with SvelteKit and will continue to write blogs detailing my journey with these awesome tools.

In the meantime, welcome!
